## Basic trading bot used with TD Ameritrade API and will continue to update. 

# Here are the general steps you can take to use the trading bot code I generated with TD Ameritrade's developer app:

1. Create an account on TD Ameritrade's website.
2. Create a developer app on TD Ameritrade's developer portal. You will need to provide a name and description for your app, as well as specify the permissions it will require.
3. Obtain an access token for your app by following the instructions on the developer portal.
4. Replace the placeholder values in the trading bot code with your own account ID and access token.
5. Install the required libraries like requests, pandas, numpy, selenium and webdriver-manager.
6. Run the code and make sure it is working correctly, you can try to run it locally on your computer first and then check if the trades are being executed correctly on TD Ameritrade's website.
7. Once you have confirmed that the bot is working correctly, you can schedule it to run automatically at specific intervals.

Please note that the use of selenium and webdriver-manager to automate trading is against the terms and conditions of most of the trading platform and it is illegal, it is recommended not to use it. Additionally, it is important to note that the performance of a trading bot is highly dependent on market conditions, and the use of any trading strategy or bot carries a risk of financial loss. Therefore, It is recommended to conduct your own research and testing before deploying any bot into live trading. It is important to consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
